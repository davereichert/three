            If I am honest, I don’t really know where to start this, so I am just going to steal from your letter a bit.
            Before I got to know you, as you might imagine, I never really talked with more than necessary. So it really was
            a new experience for me, and I have to say the more we talked, the more I began to like you. And throughout the time
            we talked and I got to know more about you, that only increased, and I would be lying if at some point I kind of got
            scared of it because I didn't want to make the connection (friendship at that point) awkward because of it. So as you know,
            I tried to suppress it in hopes that it might fade with time. But that wasn't the case because with time it only grew stronger.
            Which, from what you told me, was the same with you, so luckily I was the one that could hold it longer . But in the end, I couldn't
            suppress it anymore as well, and it did really make me happy when you agreed (we both agreed of course) on us trying to make this relationship work.
            And from this day till now, it still makes me really happy ❤.
          </p>
          <p>
            I know even though we have a lot in common on this, our views still differ. While you view yourself as ugly or incapable of doing anything
            and undeserving of anything, I view you as a beautiful girl with a good sense of humor, who is very smart and ambitious about her goals and
            gives everything she can to achieve them, sometimes even gets overambitious. On top of that, no matter how many times you get knocked down and feel hopeless,
            you always stand up again and give it your best again and again and again till you achieve your goal. All that combined is the image I have of you and, as I said before, that
            you are my dream woman ❤.
          </p>
          <p>
            So even if there come dark times, no matter how dark, there will always be a source of light for you and my helping hand to get you out of the dark pit.
            What I am trying to say with this is that no matter how bad and dark the situation is, there will always be hope, and I will always be there to help you.
            Even if you might think you are a burden to me, that won’t stop me from wanting to give it my best at helping the girl I love so much.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am writing this because I know that at the moment you aren't feeling well, so I did this as a way of cheering you up a bit. I hope it worked.
          </p>
